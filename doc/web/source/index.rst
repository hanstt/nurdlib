NUstar ReaDout LIBrary - Nurdlib
================================

The definite library for readout of data collection modules commonly used in nuclear physics experiments. Made in Germany.

Example Config
--------------

.. code-block:: ini

    # Name and crate ID
    CRATE("VME0")
    {
            # Use multi-event readout
            multi_event = true
            # Type + address
            GSI_TRIDI(0x02000000) {}
            CAEN_V775(0x00010000)
            {
                    common_start = true
                    time_range = 1200 ns
            }
    }

Installation
------------

The short version for the impatient:

Install Nurdlib::

    git clone lx-pool.gsi.de:/u/htoernqv/repos/nurdlib.git
    cd nurdlib
    export NURDLIB_DEF_PATH=$(pwd)/cfg/default
    make

To run all tests::

    make test

* Single cycle and block transfer
* TRLO II support
* Strict ANSI C compliance and harsh GCC flags
* Offline unit testing with coverage report
* Code unification and readability has high priority
* Command line monitoring and configuration tool
* External memory access and testing tools

Building Nurdlib
----------------

The Nurdlib build system is based on non-recursive GNU makefiles and a custom auto-configuration tool called nconf. All generated files are placed inside Nurdlib in a directory of the form::

    build_<gcc machine>_<gcc version>_<build mode>/

including the static library libnurdlib.a. Link your DAQ binary with this library and you're done. The somewhat complicated build directory name eliminates collisions between several builds across platforms and build modes with the same sources.

Testing and coverage
--------------------

Unit testing is done with ntest, and coverage analysis with gcov. Testing works in any build mode, but coverage requires instrumentation which reduces runtime performance a lot, and is disabled by default. Nurdlib has coverage-specific build targets to report the results after the test target has executed at least once:

* cov - Small summary of all results.
* cov_files - File-level report (gcov -n).
* cov_funcs - Function-level report (gcov -fn).
* cov_anno - Annotated files placed in $BUILD_DIR/cov/ (gcov -lp).

Build in cov mode::

    make BUILD_MODE=cov test
    make BUILD_MODE=cov cov
    make BUILD_MODE=cov cov_files
    make BUILD_MODE=cov cov_funcs
    make BUILD_MODE=cov cov_anno

Release mode
------------

When you are done debugging, build in release mode::

    make BUILD_MODE=release

Build for shared library use
----------------------------

To be used as a shared object, which is needed for the Python control support, the additional ``-fPIC`` compile flag is needed. This usually may have a performance impact and is therefore disabled by default. The ``pic`` build mode enables this flag::

    make BUILD_MODE=pic

Utils
-----

Inspect a running Nurdlib::

    ./bin/nurdctrl --crates
    ./bin/nurdctrl --crate=0 --crate-info
    ./bin/nurdctrl --crate=0 --module=2 --register-dump

Dump the read/write module registers directly::

    ./bin/rwdump -a 0x02000000 -r 32

Online read/write with nurdctrl is not implemented to reduce the risk of
locking up a running DAQ (there are enough lurking dangers for a DAQ).

Development status
------------------

We believe in community support and openness when developing this library, and therefore publish an updated development status regularly `right here <http://web-docs.gsi.de/~land/nurdlib/old/dev.html>`_!
